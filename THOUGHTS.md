ðŸ¤” THOUGHTS.md â€“ Design & Learning Log
ðŸŽ¯ Product Thinking
Designed for Indian students aged 15â€“22, covering high school and early college.

Goal: Simulate a counselor-style experience using data + conversation.

Modular interface: Aptitude â†’ Goals â†’ Skills â†’ Recommendations.

Adaptable for NEP pathways, regional languages, and future government APIs.

ðŸ§  ML/NLP Design Decisions
Aptitude Prediction
Model: Random Forest Classifier (interpretable + robust)

Reason: Works well for categorical psychometric data.

Goal & Interest Extraction
Model: Sentence-BERT for embeddings

Tools: Whisper API for audio-to-text transcription

Reason: Needed deep semantic understanding of varied inputs.

Skill Matching
Approach: Sentence-BERT embeddings + cosine similarity

Challenge: Creating clean vectors for multi-disciplinary skills

Recommendation Logic
Base Logic: Rule-based links between exams (JEE â†’ Engineering, NEET â†’ Medicine)

Refinement: ML ranking on profile similarity

Reason: Combine explainability with personalization

Skill Gap Engine
Model: K-Nearest Neighbors for profile proximity

Courses: Curated NEP-aligned Coursera, NPTEL, and SWAYAM links

ðŸ“ˆ Learnings
NLP understanding of user inputs required good preprocessing (especially Hindi-English mix).

Indian academic data is fragmented â†’ building a robust ontology was hard.

Visual explainability helped gain trust in AI outputs.

Many students lack awareness of career paths â†’ UI had to educate as well.

ðŸš§ Challenges
Audio transcription for Indian accents

Merging structured test data with unstructured language data

Limited public datasets that link skills with Indian careers

ðŸ”® Roadmap
Chatbot interface for dynamic career Q&A

Regional language NLP using AI4Bharat

Resume/LinkedIn scraping

Real-time dashboard with career readiness index
