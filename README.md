This project is an AI-powered career guidance system designed to assist students in the Indian education system. It leverages machine learning and natural language processing techniques to:

- Analyze student aptitude
- Extract career aspirations
- Map skills to relevant career options
- Provide personalized career recommendations
- Identify skill gaps for targeted improvement

## Features

- Aptitude analysis using machine learning models
- NLP-based extraction of career aspirations from text inputs
- Skill mapping and skill gap analysis for targeted learning
- Interactive career recommendation engine tailored to individual profiles

## Technologies Used

- Python programming language
- Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch for machine learning
- NLTK or SpaCy for natural language processing
- Flask or Django for web application interface (optional)
